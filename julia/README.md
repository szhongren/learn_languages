# Julia Learning Repository

A comprehensive guide to learning the Julia programming language from basics to advanced topics.

## Prerequisites
- Julia 1.7+ installed (we're using Julia 1.7.2)

## Structure

### 01_basics/
- Variables and basic types
- Operators and expressions
- Basic I/O

### 02_control_flow/
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Exception handling

### 03_data_structures/
- Arrays and matrices
- Dictionaries and sets
- Tuples and named tuples

### 04_functions/
- Function definitions
- Multiple dispatch
- Anonymous functions
- Higher-order functions

### 05_modules_packages/
- Creating modules
- Package management with Pkg
- Using external packages

### 06_advanced_topics/
- Metaprogramming and macros
- Performance optimization
- Parallel computing
- Interoperability with other languages

### 07_practical_examples/
- Data analysis examples
- Mathematical computations
- File I/O and data processing

### exercises/
- Practice problems with solutions

## Getting Started

1. Make sure Julia is installed: `julia --version`
2. Start with `01_basics/` and work through each section
3. Run examples with: `julia filename.jl`
4. For interactive exploration, use: `julia` to start the REPL

## Running Examples

All code examples are tested and should run without errors. To run a specific example:

```bash
julia 01_basics/variables.jl
```

## Tips for Learning

- Use the Julia REPL for experimentation
- Try modifying examples to understand concepts better
- Complete exercises to reinforce learning
- Refer to [Julia Documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/) for deeper details
