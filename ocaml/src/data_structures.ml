(* RECORD TYPES:
   - Records are structured data with named fields
   - Fields are separated by semicolons
   - Field types are specified with 'field_name : type'
   - Records are immutable by default
   - Similar to structs in other languages *)
type person = {
  name : string;    (* Field name with string type *)
  age : int;        (* Field age with int type *)
  email : string;   (* Field email with string type *)
}

(* VARIANT TYPES (ALGEBRAIC DATA TYPES):
   - Variants represent values that can be one of several forms
   - Each variant constructor starts with capital letter
   - Constructors can carry data (like 'float' for Circle)
   - Tuples in constructors: (type1 * type2 * ...)
   - Similar to enums but can carry different data types *)
type shape =
  | Circle of float                    (* Circle carries one float (radius) *)
  | Rectangle of float * float         (* Rectangle carries tuple (width, height) *)
  | Triangle of float * float * float  (* Triangle carries three floats (sides) *)

(* RECORD CONSTRUCTION AND FIELD ACCESS:
   - Records created with { field1 = value1; field2 = value2; ... }
   - Field access uses dot notation: record.field
   - 'with' keyword creates new record copying existing one with changes
   - All fields must be provided unless using 'with' *)
let records () =
  let alice = { name = "Alice"; age = 30; email = "alice@example.com" } in
  let bob = { alice with name = "Bob"; age = 25 } in  (* Copy alice, change name and age *)
  Printf.printf "%s is %d years old\n" alice.name alice.age;  (* Field access *)
  Printf.printf "%s is %d years old\n" bob.name bob.age

(* VARIANT PATTERN MATCHING:
   - Variants are deconstructed using pattern matching
   - Constructor names must match exactly
   - Variables in patterns extract the carried data
   - Tuples are deconstructed with (var1, var2, ...)
   - Float arithmetic uses '.' operators: +., -., *., /. *)

(* ARRAYS AND STRINGS:
   - Arrays are mutable, fixed-size collections
   - Array literal: [| element1; element2; ... |]
   - Array access: array.(index)
   - Array mutation: array.(index) <- new_value
   - Strings are immutable sequences of characters
   - String functions: String.length, String.sub *)
